👨‍💻 About Me

I am a final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student with hands-on experience in embedded systems, IoT, automation, robotics, and AI-based inspection systems. My work focuses on building reliable, sensor-driven systems using ESP32 and Arduino, combined with real-time data acquisition, MQTT communication, and machine-vision workflows using OpenCV.

I have practical exposure to industrial monitoring concepts, automation fundamentals, and end-to-end system implementation — from simulation and debugging to cloud dashboard integration.
